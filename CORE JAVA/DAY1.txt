PIJ(COREJAVA SE7)
---------

Why do we learn a program language?
1.to create software/application
2.to do the task easier
3.to become a developer
4.to do a specific tasks etc

--- we should be strong enough to 
understand and learn
a programming language.


Structure of the JAVA Programming code:
---------------------------------------

import statements;
package statements;


class classname
{
public static void main(String[]
 args)
{

}
}


class - keyword.
every java programming code has a
 class.
because java is a Object Oriented 
Programming Language

main - entry point of the 
applications.

when we execute a program,
 main is the
 first line to
be executed in a program.

After writing a java code, 
two steps to be done.

1. Compile - to check whether the
 
code or syntax of the 
program is correct or not.

javac Student.java

2. Run - this will display the 
output
 to the user.

java Student

Example code:

class Student
{
public static void main(String[]
 args)
{
System.out.println("Welcome to
 First
 JAVA Code");
}
}

System - namespace, 
which is responsible for all I/O 
operations.
Namespace is a collection of 
classes.

out - one of the classes of 
System namespace, which is used
for displaying output to the user.

println - method to print the 
text on 
the screen 

Example 02:
-----------


System(namespace)
|
out (class)
|
print or println(method)


class Employee
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
System.out.println("welcome");
System.out.println("To java 
    batch");
}
}

-----------------------------------------------------
To save information in a program:

--- we have to use variables.

Variables  - are the names given
 to 
the program to store
data inside it..


No1=12,No2=5
Name="NIIT"
marks=45.3

-- datatype of the program
What kind of data that we store 
in the
 program
number, character, point values, 
string values...

The various datatype available are:

int - for storing numbers
char - characters
float and double - storing point values.
String - for storing words/sentences.
boolean - for storing true/false values.

int no=5
char grade='A'
float marks=43.7F;
double average=45.7890000;
String name="Arun";
boolean result=true;

==========================================================
class Employee
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
int a=5,b=4;
System.out.println(a+b);

float x=45.3f,y=89.4F;
System.out.println(x+y);

double d1=45.32,d2=908.4;
System.out.println(d1*d2);

}
}

===========================================================
Rule1:
the class which contains the main
 method, in that class name
only the program has to be saved.

Rule2:
There can be only one main method
 in a program


Function - is a block of code.. 
which contains the specific
logic to executed in a program..

class ATM
{

void withdraw(){

}

void pinchange(){

}

void balanceenquiry(){

}

}

Rule 3:
When we create any new classes ,
other than the class
which contains main method,
 the object has to be created.

classname Objname=new classname();

new[operator] - used to allocate 
the
 memory.

Example code:

class Calculator
{
void addition()
{
int a=5,b=10;
System.out.println(a+b);
}
}
class Employee
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
Calculator c=new Calculator();
c.addition();
}
}
